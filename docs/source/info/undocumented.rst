Undocumented endpoints
=======================

A complete list of endpoints can be obtained by peering into the game files and looking for functions that handle the requests to and responses from these. This allows us to know which endpoints exist, but have not yet been documented. Some of these are very likely to be unused and impossible to trigger.

List
------

These are endpoints which may be possible to trigger, but which have yet to be documented. If you have any ideas about how to trigger them, please get in touch!
